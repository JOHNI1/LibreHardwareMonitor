unzip and open the file at the directory of the whole project

change MainForm.cs
comment out the if statement and the else and the server.stop....

save and go to snl or something like that and right click and build - > 
make sure to use visual studio 2019 cuz that worked for me!
also make sure to download .net framework devkit 4.6.1 <- at the beggining when I tried to build it said that it needs .net framework 4.5 but when I 
opened it with visual studio 2019 it automatically suggesed me to upgrade the project to use 4.6.1 so that's good!

the build will be inside bin/debug

copy the debug file and past in where the OHM should be and create shortcut (win + r -> shell:startup)

the video I followed to force ran OpenHardwareMonitor since it needs admin priviledges.
